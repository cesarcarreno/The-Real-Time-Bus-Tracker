Real-Time Bus Tracker

Description of the project

It shows the bus stops between MIT and Cambridge's most reviewed restaurant "Russel House Tavern". The project was originally showing the bus stops between MIT and Harvard.  The improvements are that the initial marker now starts over the restaurant and after the button is pressed than it animates the bus stops to the new location.

How to Run

Roadmap of future improvements:

In future versions if the map adopted to nightmode it would be easier to read since most people will go to a Tavern at nighttime.
